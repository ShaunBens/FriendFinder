## Overview
Friend Finder is a basic full-stack web application that utilizes HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/Javascript/jQuery for the front end and Nodejs/Express/Path/body-parser for the back-end.

Users will arrive at a landing page and be introduced with a button click to begin their survey. The 10 questions and the Name/PhotoURL inputs will be completed by the user.

After pressing submit, a little behind the scenes magic happens when your total score value is compared with our database of existing "friends" and the "Best Match" is found by getting a difference between the user and the friend with the closest difference between their total score.

This info is then pushed to a bootstrap modal which appears with the Name and Photo of your "Best Match" friend.
The app is deployed to a heroku server and does go to sleep when not in use. Please don't mind the initial slow load time of my app. :)

Feel free to play with the app for as long as you like and see what matches you can come up with! The results are fun!
